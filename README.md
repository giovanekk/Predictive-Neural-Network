I worked for a wholesale clothing company over the winter and have access to a database with columns indicating company name, quantity bought, amount returned, total value, discount, gross profit, state, date of purchase, date of first purchase, time of purchase, LLC number, SSN, etc. Each row represents a purchase from a customer. The company used software developed by a local programmer in Sao Paulo, Brazil, as their database, and I downloaded two .csv files with all the information from the beginning of 2023 to the beginning of 2025. I will be changing some sensitive information such as company names and SNNs.
The project is a neural network model trained on this data to try to make a gross income prediction of a given purchase based on multiple factors. To do this, I implemented several data science techniques. I utilized the pandas library to clean the data, create new columns with valuable information, and format the data to use in the neural network. I also utilized K-means clustering and one-hot encoding to make the data fit as an input for my neural network model.
